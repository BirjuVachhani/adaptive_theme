# Adaptive Theme

Easiest way to add support for light and dark theme in your flutter app.
It allows to manually set light or dark theme and also lets you define
themes based on the system (Works for Android only for now). It also persists
the theme modes changes across app restarts.

## Installing

add following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  adaptive_theme: ^1.0.0
```

## Initialization

You need to wrap your `MaterialApp` with `AdaptiveTheme` in order to apply themes.

```dart
import 'package:adaptive_theme/adaptive_theme.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveTheme(
      light: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.light,
        primarySwatch: Colors.red,
        accentColor: Colors.amber,
      ),
      dark: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        primarySwatch: Colors.red,
        accentColor: Colors.amber,
      ),
      initial: AdaptiveThemeMode.light,
      builder: (theme, darkTheme) => MaterialApp(
        title: 'Adaptive Theme Demo',
        theme: theme,
        darkTheme: darkTheme,
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Changing Theme Mode

Now that you have initialized your app as mentioned above. It's very easy and straight
forward to change your theme modes: **light to dark, dark to light or to system default**.

```dart
// sets theme mode to dark
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).setDark();

// sets theme mode to light
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).setLight();

// sets theme mode to system default
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).setSystem();
```

## Toggle Theme Mode

`AdaptiveTheme` allows you to toggle between light and dark theme the
easiest way possible.

```dart
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).toggleThemeMode();
```

## Changing Themes

If you want to change the theme entirely like change all the colors to  
some other color swatch, then you can use `setTheme` method.

```dart
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).setTheme(
  light: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.light,
    primarySwatch: Colors.purple,
    accentColor: Colors.amber,
  ),
  dark: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
    primarySwatch: Colors.purple,
    accentColor: Colors.amber,
  ),
);
```

## Reset Theme

`AdaptiveTheme` is smart enough to keep your default themes handy that
you provided at the time of initialization. You can fallback to those
default themes in a very easy way.

```dart
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).reset();
```

This will reset your theme as well as theme mode to the initial values
provided at the time of initialization.

## Set Default Theme

`AdaptiveTheme` persists theme mode changes across app restarts and uses
the default themes to set theme modes(light/dark) on. You can change
this behavior if you want to set a different theme as default theme
other then the one provided at the time of initialization.

This comes handy when you're fetching themes remotely on app starts and
setting theme as current theme.

Doing so is quit easy. You would set a new theme normally as you do by
calling `setTheme` method but this time, with a flag `isDefault` set to
true.

> This is only useful when you might want to reset to default theme at
> some point.

```dart
AdaptiveTheme.of(context).setTheme(
  light: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.light,
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    accentColor: Colors.amber,
  ),
  dark: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    accentColor: Colors.amber,
  ),
  isDefault: true,
);
```

## Get ThemeMode at App Start

When you change your theme, next app run won't be able to pick the most recent theme directly before
rendering with default 1 time. This is because at time of initialization, we cannot run async code
to get previous theme mode. However it can be avoided if you make your `main()` method async and
load previous theme mode asynchonously. Below example shows how it can be done.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final savedThemeMode = await AdaptiveTheme.getThemeMode();
  runApp(MyApp(savedThemeMode: savedThemeMode));
}
```

```dart
AdaptiveTheme(
  light: lightTheme,
  dark: darkTheme,
  initial: savedThemeMode ?? AdaptiveThemeMode.light,
  builder: (theme, darkTheme) => MaterialApp(
    title: 'Adaptive Theme Demo',
    theme: theme,
    darkTheme: darkTheme,
    home: MyHomePage(),
  ),
)
```
Notice that I passed the retrieved theme mode to my material app so that I can use it while
initializing the default theme. This helps avoiding theme change flickering on app startup.

## Ceveats

#### Non-Persist theme changes

> This is only useful in scenarios where you load your themes dynamically
> from network in the splash screen or some initial screens of the app.
> Please note that `AdaptiveTheme` does not persist the themes, it only
> persists the theme modes(light/dark/system). Any changes made to the
> provided themes won't be persisted and you will have to do the same
> changes at the time of the initialization if you want them to apply
> every time app is opened. e.g changing the accent color.

#### Using SharedPreferences

> This package uses `sharedpreferences` plugin internally to persist
> theme mode changes. If your app uses `sharedpreferences` which might
> be the case all the time, clearing your `sharedpreferences` at the
> time of logging out or signing out might clear these preferences too.
> Be careful not to clear these preferences if you want it to be persisted.

```dart
AdaptiveTheme.prefKey
```

You can use above key to exclude it while clearing the all the preferences.

Or you can call `AdaptiveTheme.persist()` method after clearing the preferences to make it
persistable again as shown below.

```dart
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
await pref.clear();
AdaptiveTheme.persist();
```
