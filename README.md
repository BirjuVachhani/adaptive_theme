# Adaptive Theme

Easiest way to add support for light and dark theme in your flutter app.
It allows to manually set light or dark theme and also lets you define
themes based on the system (Works for Android only for now). It also persists
the theme modes changes across app restarts.

```yaml
// TODO:
```
